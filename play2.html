        <h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"> LORD DARLINGTON </h6> <p class="speech">Don’t say that, Duchess.  As a wicked man I am a
            complete failure.  Why, there are lots of people who say I have never
            really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.  Of course
            they only say it behind my back.<br></p> 
        
        <h6 class="name DUCHESSOFBERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6> <p class="speech">Isn’t he dreadful?  Agatha, this is LORD DARLINGTON.
            Mind you don’t believe a word he says.  [ LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._]
            No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]  We have just
            had tea at Lady Markby’s.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.
            I wasn’t at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is
            looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.<br></p> 
        
        <h6 class="name WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6><p class="speech">  [_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustn’t think it is going to
            be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A
            small and early.<br></p>
