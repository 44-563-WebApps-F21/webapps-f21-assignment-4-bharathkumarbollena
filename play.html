        <p>_Morning-room of Lord Windermere’s house in Carlton House Terrace_.
            _Doors C. and R.  Bureau with books and papers R._  _Sofa with small
            tea-table L._  _Window opening on to terrace L._  _Table R._</p> 
            <p> 
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6><p> Don’t talk about such people.<br></p>
                
                <h6>LORD DARLINGTON</h6><p> Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of
                    course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have
                    committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?<br></p> 
                
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6> <p> [_Standing at table_.]  I think they should never be
                    forgiven.<br></p>
                
                <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6><p> And men?  Do you think that there should be the same
                    laws for men as there are for women?<br></p> 
                
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6><p>  Certainly!<br></p>
                
                <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6><p> I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these
                    hard and fast rules.<br></p> 
                
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6> <p> If we had ‘these hard and fast rules,’ we should find
                    life much more simple.<br></p>
                
                <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6> <p> You allow of no exceptions?<br></p>
                
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6><p>  None!<br></p>
                
                <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6><p> Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady
                    Windermere!<br></p>
                
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6> <p> The adjective was unnecessary, <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6>.<br></p>
                
                <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6><p>  I couldn’t help it.  I can resist everything except
                    temptation.<br></p>
                
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6> <p> You have the modern affectation of weakness.<br></p>
                
                <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6><p> [_Looking at her_.]  It’s only an affectation, Lady
                    Windermere.<br></p> 
                
                [_Enter_ PARKER _C._]<br>
                
                <h6>PARKER</h6>.  The Duchess of Berwick and Lady Agatha Carlisle.<br>
                
                <p>[_Enter the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK and LADY AGATHA CARLISLE _C._]<br></p>
                
                                                                      [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]<br>
                
                <h6>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6> <p>[_Coming down C._, _and shaking hands_.]  Dear
                    Margaret, I am so pleased to see you.  You remember Agatha, don’t you?
                    [_Crossing L.C._]  How do you do, <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6>?  I won’t let you know
                    my daughter, you are far too wicked.</p> [_Coming down C._, _and shaking hands_.]  Dear
                Margaret, I am so pleased to see you.  You remember Agatha, don’t you?
                [_Crossing L.C._]  How do you do, <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6>?  I won’t let you know
                my daughter, you are far too wicked.
                <br>
                <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6> <p>Don’t say that, Duchess.  As a wicked man I am a
                    complete failure.  Why, there are lots of people who say I have never
                    really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.  Of course
                    they only say it behind my back.<br></p> 
                
                <h6>DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6> <p>Isn’t he dreadful?  Agatha, this is <h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6>.
                    Mind you don’t believe a word he says.  [<h6> LORD DARLINGTON </h6> _crosses R.C._]
                    No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]  We have just
                    had tea at Lady Markby’s.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.
                    I wasn’t at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is
                    looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.<br></p> 
                
                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6><p>  [_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustn’t think it is going to
                    be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A
                    small and early.<br></p>
