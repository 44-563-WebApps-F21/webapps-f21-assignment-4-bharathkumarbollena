                    course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have
                    committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?<br></p> 
                
                <h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6> <p class="speech"> [_Standing at table_.]  I think they should never be

                <h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"> LORD DARLINGTON </h6><p class="speech"> And men?  Do you think that there should be the same
                    laws for men as there are for women?<br></p> 
                
                <h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6><p class="speech">  Certainly!<br></p>
                
                <h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"> LORD DARLINGTON </h6><p class="speech"> I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these
                    hard and fast rules.<br></p> 
                
                <h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6> <p class="speech"> If we had ‘these hard and fast rules,’ we should find

                <h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"> LORD DARLINGTON </h6> <p class="speech">Don’t say that, Duchess.  As a wicked man I am a
                    complete failure.  Why, there are lots of people who say I have never
                    really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.  Of course
                    they only say it behind my back.<br></p>

                    Mind you don’t believe a word he says.  [ LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._]
                    No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]  We have just
                    had tea at Lady Markby’s.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.
                    I wasn’t at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is
                    looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.<br></p>

                    be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A
                    small and early.<br></p>
