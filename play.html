                LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t talk about such people.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of
                course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have
                committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing at table_.]  I think they should never be
                forgiven.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  And men?  Do you think that there should be the same
                laws for men as there are for women?
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Certainly!
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these
                hard and fast rules.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  If we had ‘these hard and fast rules,’ we should find
                life much more simple.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  You allow of no exceptions?
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  None!
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady
                Windermere!
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  I couldn’t help it.  I can resist everything except
                temptation.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  You have the modern affectation of weakness.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Looking at her_.]  It’s only an affectation, Lady
                Windermere.
                
                [_Enter_ PARKER _C._]
                
                PARKER.  The Duchess of Berwick and Lady Agatha Carlisle.
                
                [_Enter the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK and LADY AGATHA CARLISLE _C._]
                
                                                                      [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Coming down C._, _and shaking hands_.]  Dear
                Margaret, I am so pleased to see you.  You remember Agatha, don’t you?
                [_Crossing L.C._]  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  I won’t let you know
                my daughter, you are far too wicked.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  Don’t say that, Duchess.  As a wicked man I am a
                complete failure.  Why, there are lots of people who say I have never
                really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.  Of course
                they only say it behind my back.
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Isn’t he dreadful?  Agatha, this is Lord Darlington.
                Mind you don’t believe a word he says.  [LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._]
                No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]  We have just
                had tea at Lady Markby’s.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.
                I wasn’t at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is
                looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustn’t think it is going to
                be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A
                small and early.
